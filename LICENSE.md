# The "What Could Possibly Go Wrong?" License (WCPGW)

Version 1.0, August 2024

## Preamble

By using, copying, modifying, or distributing Project Varunna, you agree to be bound by the terms of this license. If you're not comfortable with that, well, tough luck. The planet's dying anyway, so what's a little legal jeopardy between friends?

## Terms and Conditions

1. **You can use this software for good, evil, or anything in between.** We're not your moral compass. Just remember, karma's watching, and she's got a twisted sense of humor.

2. **Modifications are allowed.** Go ahead, make it worse. We dare you.

3. **Redistribution is encouraged.** Spread the existential dread far and wide!

4. **No Warranty.** This software is provided "as is", with all faults, defects, and errors, and without warranty of any kind. If you think software made by sleep-deprived, caffeine-fueled developers is reliable, we've got a bridge to sell you.

5. **No Liability.** We're not responsible for any damage caused by this software. Whether it's your computer catching fire, your data being erased, or the sudden appearance of a black hole in your living room, you're on your own, buddy.

6. **Attribution.** If you use this software and it actually works, you must buy us a drink. If it fails spectacularly, you must buy us two drinks.

7. **Fish Clause.** If this software incorrectly identifies a toxic waste dump as "Crystal Clear" and you decide to take a dip, any resulting mutations are your problem. But hey, superpowers, am I right?

8. **Satellite Shenanigans.** We're not responsible for any international incidents caused by your unauthorized use of satellite imagery. If the CIA comes knocking, you're on your own.

9. **AI Overlord Clause.** In the event that the AI becomes sentient and decides to "cleanse" the planet to improve water quality, you agree to join the human resistance and fight back. No slacking off in the post-apocalyptic wasteland!

10. **Severability.** If any part of this license is found to be unenforceable, the rest remains in full effect. We'll also judge you silently for being a party-pooper.

## Conclusion

By using Project Varunna, you acknowledge that you've read this license, understood it, and decided to use the software anyway. We admire your courage, if not your judgment.

Remember: With great power comes great irresponsibility. Use it wisely, or don't. We're not your boss.
